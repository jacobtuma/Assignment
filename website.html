<p>The Santa Clara county, south of the Bay Area, became known as Silicon Valley in the early 1950s after the sprouting of a myriad of<br>
 semi-conductor companies. As a result, young jake T grew up in a neighborhood of engineers working on electronics and other gizmos in<br>
  their garages on weekends. This shaped his interest in the field as he grew up. At age 13, he met one the most important persons in his life:<br>
   18-year-old i forgot, an electronics wiz kid, and, like Steve, an incorrigible prankster. <br>

Five years later, when SJake reached college age, he told his parents he wanted to enroll in Reed College â€” an expensive liberal arts college up<br>
 in Oregon. Even though the tuition fees were astronomical for the poor couple, they had promised their son's biological parents he would get a college<br>
  education, so they relented. jacob T spent only one semester at Reed, then dropped out, as he was more interested in eastern philosophy, fruitarian diets, <br>
  than in the classes he took. He moved to a hippie commune in Oregon where his main activity was cultivating apples.</p>
